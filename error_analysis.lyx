\begin_layout Abstract
These are pedagogical error analysis notes written for 1st/2nd year physics
 undergraduate students as a response to feedback from students that there
 was not sufficient coverage of these ideas in their coursework.
 The notes contain Basic materials, roughly commensurate with what a typical
 undergraduate physics major requires (basic concepts, error estimation
 in measurement and from graphs, and linear error propagation), and Advanced
 Topics for keen students wishing to learn about probability theory, the
 two major schools of statistics (Bayesian and frequentist) and Monte Carlo
 techniques for non-linear error propagation.
 A list of materials for further reading is also provided.

\begin_layout Quotation
We all know that there are good and bad experiments.
 The latter accumulate in vain.
 Whether there are a hundred or a thousand, one single piece of work by
 a real master - by a Pasteur, for example - will be sufficient to sweep
 them into oblivion.

Sometimes an entire field can develop bad habits which have become so ingrained
 that you just have to learn to live with them.
 In physics one of our bad habits is the use of the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

error,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

error analysis.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Our students would be greatly helped if we just used the common English
 word that actually means what we have in mind: uncertainty.
 Get this straight: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

error
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as used in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

error analysis
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means 
\emph on
uncertainty
\emph default
, or 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plausible magnitude of possible errors 
\emph default
(in the ordinary sense)
\emph on
 in a measured quantity
\emph default
.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 For the rest of these notes I will use the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

error
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 synonymously with uncertainty, as is standard in the physics literature.

Physics is a quantitative science which seeks to establish predictive relationsh
ips between quantities which can somehow be numerically measured in the
 real world.
 But our senses are easily fooled, and our instruments are

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 reliable in proportion with their cost.
 When you open up a physics or mathematics textbook you'll often find problems
 where all the relevant data is given to you without any uncertainty, and
 often with a suspicious number of digits (

).
 Reality is seldom so kind.
 We often must make decisions with imperfect and/or incomplete information.
 To make any progress we must find ways of analysing data and making predictions
 that are compatible with the

 of real data.

One of the major benefits to be had from a physics education for people
 who do not go into a physics research career is an appreciation of how
 to estimate, reason with, and live with uncertainty.
 It is really a more self-aware and robust version of ordinary common sense
 \SpecialChar \nobreakdash-
 a training of sceptical and critical thinking skills that are useful in
 any walk of life.
 Unfortunately this important aspect of physics education can often go 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

under the radar,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 without systematic development.
 Lectures are focused on theory, tutorials are focused on homework style
 problems, and in the interest of time and student safety the laboratories
 are often

 endeavours which allow little of the creative problem solving and experimentati
on that can make physics laboratories truly great.
 They also afford little time for honing error analysis skills.

These notes hopefully go some way toward filling the gap.
 These notes are structured in two major sections apart from this introduction.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Basics"

\end_inset

 addresses the basic topics that you are most likely to need in your course.
 Master this material and you should have no trouble at all on the error
 analysis sections of your lab reports.
 Fortunately the mathematics involved is not really difficult - the most
 advanced thing you'll need is to be able to find the linear approximation
 to a function of several variables at a given point (i.e., partial derivatives).
 In practice, with the rules of thumb you'll find here, the cases where
 you actually have to do this calculation are rare.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Advanced-Topics"

\end_inset

 covers 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Advanced Topics.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 These are optional extras for the interested student.
 These start with a review of probability theory, which by Cox's theorem
 is the unique extension of ordinary (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aristotlean
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) logic to handle uncertain propositions.
 From there we discuss the two schools of statistics (the 
\emph on
Bayesians
\emph default
, who were the first and are now staging a major comeback, and the 
\emph on
frequentists
\emph default
, who dominated the statistics of the 20th century) and their different
 approaches to uncertainty, parameter estimation and hypothesis testing.
 Finally we discuss Monte Carlo techniques and their use in propagating
 non-linear uncertainties.
 The basic idea is to simulate error-prone measurements many times with
 a computer's random number generator and look at the distribution of results
 obtained for the calculation(s) of interest.
 A bibliography containing further reading material is provided for students
 who want to explore further.
 Happy trails!
