\begin_layout Abstract
These are pedagogical error analysis notes written for 1st/2nd year physics
 undergraduate students as a response to feedback from students that there
 was not sufficient coverage of these ideas in their coursework.
 The notes contain Basic materials, roughly commensurate with what a typical
 undergraduate physics major requires (basic concepts, error estimation
 in measurement and from graphs, and linear error propagation), and Advanced
 Topics for keen students wishing to learn about probability theory, the
 two major schools of statistics (Bayesian and frequentist) and Monte Carlo
 techniques for non-linear error propagation.
 A list of materials for further reading and a summary

Sometimes an entire field can develop bad habits which have become so ingrained

 In physics one of our bad habits is the use of the word

error analysis.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Our students would be greatly helped if we just used the common English
 word that actually means what we have in mind: uncertainty.
 Get this straight:

Physics is a quantitative science which seeks to establish predictive relationsh

 real world.
 But our senses are easily fooled, and our instruments are

\end_layout

\end_inset

 reliable in proportion with their cost.
 When you open up a physics or mathematics textbook you'll often find problems
 where all the relevant data is given to you without any uncertainty, and
 often with a suspicious number of digits (

 To make any progress we must find ways of analysing data and making predictions
 that are compatible with the

One of the major benefits to be had from a physics education for people
 who do not go into a physics research career is an appreciation of how
 to estimate, reason with, and live with uncertainty.
 It is really a more self-aware and robust version of ordinary common sense
 \SpecialChar \nobreakdash-
 a training of sceptical and critical thinking skills that are useful in
 any walk of life.
 Unfortunately this important aspect of physics education can often go 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

under the radar,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 without systematic development.
 Lectures are focused on theory, tutorials are focused on homework style
 problems, and in the interest of time and student safety the laboratories

These notes hopefully go some way toward filling the gap.
 These notes are structured in two major sections apart from this introduction.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 addresses the basic topics that you are most likely to need in your course.
 Master this material and you should have no trouble at all on the error
 analysis sections of your lab reports.
 Fortunately the mathematics involved is not really difficult - the most
 advanced thing you'll need is to be able to find the linear approximation
 to a function of several variables at a given point (i.e., partial derivatives).
 In practice, with the rules of thumb you'll find here, the cases where
 you actually have to do this calculation are rare.
 Section

Advanced Topics.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 These are optional extras for the interested student.
 These start with a review of probability theory, which by Cox's theorem
 is the unique extension of ordinary (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

) logic to handle uncertain propositions.
 From there we discuss the two schools of statistics (the

, who were the first and are now staging a major comeback, and the 
\emph on
frequentists
\emph default
, who dominated the statistics of the 20th century) and their different
 approaches to uncertainty, parameter estimation and hypothesis testing.
 Finally we discuss Monte Carlo techniques and their use in propagating
 non-linear uncertainties.
 The basic idea is to simulate error-prone measurements many times with
 a computer's random number generator and look at the distribution of results
 obtained for the calculation(s) of interest.
 A bibliography containing further reading material is provided for students
 who want to explore further.
 Happy trails!

Are errors really that important? In fact it is easy to imagine circumstances
 where the error or uncertainty of a measurement or prediction is at least
 as important as the central value itself.
 For example, suppose you work for

 and you have discovered a rather large asteroid on a potential collision
 course with Earth.
 What do you do? Is it the time to ring up the President and the Hollywood
 action heroes? This dilemma crops up more often than you might think.
 Near Earth asteroids are being discovered faster than ever before (Figure

.
 Yet, at present, there is no major threat from impacts.
 How is this so? Astronomical measurements are only so good, and the positions
 and velocities of these objects are only determined within some uncertainty.
 Further, as they travel along their orbits are perturbed by the gravity
 of the planets and other forces which are harder to model (e.g., the 
\emph on
Yarkovsky effect
\emph default
).
 This means that the predicted position of the asteroid at some future time
 lies within some region of uncertainty.
 If the Earth is inside that volume then there is a potential, but uncertain,
 impact.
 A probability (a number between zero and one representing a degree of certainty
) can be assigned to the impact and this can be factored into the hazard
 as measured by, for example, the Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Only impacts which rate sufficiently highly on the scale merit attention
 by officials.
 Lower scoring impacts are likely to disappear as improved measurements
 reduce the uncertainty of the predicted orbit (Figure

Another example of where estimating and reporting uncertainties is crucial
 is climate change.
 Yes, temperature is going to go up, but by how much? And how certain can
 we be of that prediction? That is the trillion dollar question.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 illustrates the range of predictions for the global average temperature.
 Reporting not only the central prediction, but also the range of likely
 values under the various scenarios allows policy makers to (in principle)
 weigh up the risks and benefits of different mitigation policies.
 It also allows one to re-frame the discussion in beneficial ways.
 For instance, instead of fruitlessly debating the

Of course, no undergraduate physics laboratory has the same level of societal
 import as the examples given above.
 Here is a more likely scenario for your course: you are measuring the emission
 spectrum of atomic hydrogen and, after carefully calibrating the equipment
 as best you can, you find that all of your measured spectral lines differ
 in wavelength from their accepted values by a few percent.
 Have you just overturned atomic theory? The answer is: no, you haven't.
 But how can you be sure? This is where error analysis comes in.
 Error analysis is something you do 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 seeing any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

accepted
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 values.
 A number of students have thought that error analysis means comparing measured
 or computed values against published values to see if they differ by, say,
 5% or less, in which case they say the measurement is compatible with the
 accepted value.
 This is completely wrong.
 Maybe you can measure to an accuracy 
\emph on
better
\emph default
 than 5%, in which case the difference is significant.
 Error analysis is knowing the accuracy and precision of your measurement
 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 looking in the back of the book.
 If you don't do the error analysis then you'll never be able to say that
 
\emph on
the number in the back of the book
\emph default
 is wrong, there is no point to doing experiments, and science would never
 advance!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make this all clear we must distinguish between three concepts: the true
 value of some quantity, its measured value, and the theoretical predicted
 value.
 The true value of a quantity is a property of the real world, independent
 of any observer (check your post-modern philosophies at the door please!).
 The measured value is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 directly related to the true value.
 It is a product of the system under study 
\emph on
along with
\emph default
 the measuring device (which may include yourself).
 
\emph on
Classical
\emph default
 intuition suggests that you can reduce the influence of the measuring device
 upon the system to such an extent that, to a very good approximation, a
 measurement can be treated as simply revealing a property of the system.
 However, our 
\emph on
quantum
\emph default
 reality is such that an absolute lower limit to this influence exists:
 measurement is the result of an irreducible interaction between a system
 and a measuring device
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I mention this for completeness.
 The quantum nature of measurements is largely irrelevant in undergraduate
 laboratories.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Finally a theoretical prediction is just that: the output of some theoretician'
s idle musings (or a rigorously defined theoretical framework).
 At the end of the day you will compare the measured value 
\emph on
with uncertainties
\emph default
, something like 
\begin_inset Formula $x\pm\Delta x$
\end_inset

, with the theoretical value 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\mathrm{th}}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $x-\Delta x\leq x_{\mathrm{th}}\leq x+\Delta x$
\end_inset

 you will say the measured value is compatible with the theory; otherwise
 it is incompatible: either the theory is wrong or inapplicable, 
\emph on
or the experiment has some unaccounted for error

It is actually possible for both of these things to be true.
 For example, in 1918 Eddington led an expedition to measure the bending
 of starlight caused by the sun's gravity.
 He announced a definite effect in agreement with Einstein's new theory
 of general relativity and overthrowing Newtonian gravity.
 This caused Einstein to become an overnight sensation.
 Later, it turned out that Eddington's measurement was in error, but Einstein
 was still right and Newton was still wrong.
 Today there are many spectacular confirmations of general relativity, including
 GPS.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Actually it is more subtle than this, as we will see.
 Often we assign a probability to an error bar rather than a certainty (i.e.,
 we say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

with a probability of 95% 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is between 
\begin_inset Formula $x-\Delta x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x+\Delta x$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Also, there can be uncertainties in the theoretical prediction due to,
 for example, approximations made in the calculation.
 So one often finds articles stating 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the data are 
\emph on
in tension
\emph default
 with the theory,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rather than contradicting it outright.
 Except, of course, for the very clear cut cases.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I mentioned accuracy and precision before.
 These are different concepts.
 An ideal measurement has both accuracy and precision.
 A measurement is 
\emph on
accurate
\emph default
 if the average of many repetitions of the measurement tends to the true
 value as the number of repetitions increases.
 If the measurement is inaccurate then the average of repetitions will converge
 to some other value than the true value.
 A 
\emph on
precise
\emph default
 measurement is one that has nearly the same value on every repetition.
 A set of repetitions of an imprecise measurement shows a great deal of
 scatter.
 These qualities can be illustrated with a target analogy.
 In this analogy a measurement is represented by an arrow shot at a target,
 with the true value at the bullseye.
 A set of repetitions is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
