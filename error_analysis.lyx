\begin_layout Abstract
These are pedagogical error analysis notes written for 1st/2nd year physics
 undergraduate students as a response to feedback from students that there
 was not sufficient coverage of these ideas in their coursework.
 The notes contain Basic materials, roughly commensurate with what a typical
 undergraduate physics major requires (basic concepts, error estimation
 in measurement and from graphs, and linear error propagation), and Advanced
 Topics for keen students wishing to learn about probability theory, the
 two major schools of statistics (Bayesian and frequentist) and Monte Carlo
 techniques for non-linear error propagation.
 A list of materials for further reading and a summary

 But our senses are easily fooled, and our instruments are

 When you open up a physics or mathematics textbook you'll often find fairy
 tale problems where all the relevant data is given to you without any uncertain
ty, and often with a suspicious number of digits (

One of the major benefits to be had from a physics education for people
 who do not go into a physics research career is an appreciation of how
 to estimate, reason with, and live with uncertainty.
 It is really a more self-aware and robust version of ordinary common sense
 \SpecialChar \nobreakdash-
 a training of sceptical and critical thinking skills that are useful in
 any walk of life.
 Unfortunately this important aspect of physics education can often go 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 without systematic development.
 Lectures are focused on theory, tutorials are focused on homework style

These notes hopefully go some way toward filling the gap.
 These notes are structured in two major sections apart from this introduction.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 addresses the basic topics that you are most likely to need in your course.
 Master this material and you should have no trouble at all on the error
 analysis sections of your lab reports.
 Fortunately the mathematics involved is not really difficult - the most
 advanced thing you'll need is to be able to find the linear approximation
 to a function of several variables at a given point (i.e., partial derivatives).
 In practice, with the rules of thumb you'll find here, the cases where
 you actually have to do this calculation are rare.
 Section

 covers 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Advanced Topics.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 These are optional extras for the interested student.
 These start with a review of probability theory, which by Cox's theorem
 is the unique extension of ordinary (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\end_inset

) logic to handle uncertain propositions.
 From there we discuss the two schools of statistics (the 
\emph on

\emph default
, who were the first and are now staging a major comeback, and the 
\emph on
frequentists
\emph default
, who dominated the statistics of the 20th century) and their different
 approaches to uncertainty, parameter estimation and hypothesis testing.
 Finally we discuss Monte Carlo techniques and their use in propagating
 non-linear uncertainties.
 The basic idea is to simulate error-prone measurements many times with
 a computer's random number generator and look at the distribution of results
 obtained for the calculation(s) of interest.
 The goal of this section is to introduce the student to some of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 concepts and tools for dealing with uncertainty that are extremely useful
 in many contexts outside of the traditional course structure.
 A bibliography containing further reading material is provided for students
 who want to explore further.

Are errors really that important? In fact it is easy to imagine circumstances
 where the error or uncertainty of a measurement or prediction is at least
 as important as the central value itself.
 For example, suppose you work for

 and you have discovered a rather large asteroid on a potential collision
 course with Earth.
 What do you do? Is it the time to ring up the President and the Hollywood
 action heroes? This dilemma crops up more often than you might think.
 Near Earth asteroids are being discovered faster than ever before (Figure

.
 Yet, at present, there is no major threat from impacts.
 How is this so?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Astronomical measurements are only so good, and the positions and velocities
 of these objects are only determined within some uncertainty.
 Further, as they travel along their orbits are perturbed by the gravity
 of the planets and other forces which are harder to model (e.g., the 
\emph on
Yarkovsky effect
\emph default
).
 This means that the predicted position of the asteroid at some future time
 lies within some region of uncertainty.
 If the Earth is inside that volume then there is a potential, but uncertain,
 impact.
 A probability (a number between zero and one representing a degree of certainty
) can be assigned to the impact and this can be factored into the hazard
 as measured by, for example, the Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PHAs"

\end_inset

.
 Only impacts which rate sufficiently highly on the scale merit attention
 by officials.
 Lower scoring impacts are likely to disappear as improved measurements
 reduce the uncertainty of the predicted orbit (Figure

Another example where estimating and reporting uncertainties is crucial
 is climate change.
 Yes, temperature is going to go up, but by how much? And how certain can
 we be of that prediction? That is the trillion dollar question.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 illustrates the range of predictions for the global average temperature.
 Reporting not only the central prediction, but also the range of likely
 values under the various scenarios allows policy makers to (in principle)
 weigh up the risks and benefits of different mitigation policies.
 It also allows one to re-frame the discussion in beneficial ways.
 For instance, instead of fruitlessly debating the 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Of course, no undergraduate physics laboratory has the same level of societal
 import as the examples given above.
 Here is a more likely scenario for your course: you are measuring the emission
 spectrum of atomic hydrogen and, after carefully calibrating the equipment
 as best you can, you find that all of your measured spectral lines differ
 in wavelength from their accepted values by a few percent.
 Have you just overturned atomic theory? The answer is: no, you haven't.
 But how can you be sure? This is where error analysis comes in.
 Error analysis is something you do 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 seeing any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

accepted
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 values.
 A number of students have thought that error analysis means comparing measured
 or computed values against published values to see if they differ by, say,
 5% or less, in which case they say the measurement is compatible with the
 accepted value.
 This is completely wrong.
 Maybe you can measure to an accuracy 
\emph on
better
\emph default
 than 5%, in which case the difference is significant.
 Error analysis is knowing the accuracy and precision of your measurement
 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 looking in the back of the book.
 If you don't do the error analysis then you'll never be able to say that
 
\emph on
the number in the back of the book
\emph default
 is wrong, there is no point to doing experiments, and science would never
 advance!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make this all clear we must distinguish between three concepts: the true
 value of some quantity, its measured value, and the theoretical predicted
 value.
 The true value of a quantity is a property of the real world, independent
 of any observer (check your post-modern philosophies at the door please!).
 The measured value is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 directly related to the true value.
 It is a product of the system under study 
\emph on
along with
\emph default
 the measuring device (which may include yourself).
 
\emph on
Classical
\emph default
 intuition suggests that you can reduce the influence of the measuring device
 upon the system to such an extent that, to a very good approximation, a
 measurement can be treated as simply revealing a property of the system.
 However, our 
\emph on
quantum
\emph default
 reality is such that an absolute lower limit to this influence exists:
 measurement is the result of an irreducible interaction between a system
 and a measuring device
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I mention this for completeness.
 The quantum nature of measurements is largely irrelevant in undergraduate
 laboratories.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Finally a theoretical prediction is just that: the output of some theoretician'
s idle musings (or a rigorously defined theoretical framework).
 At the end of the day you will compare the measured value 
\emph on
with uncertainties
\emph default
, something like 
\begin_inset Formula $x\pm\Delta x$
\end_inset

, with the theoretical value 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\mathrm{th}}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $x-\Delta x\leq x_{\mathrm{th}}\leq x+\Delta x$
\end_inset

 you will say the measured value is compatible with the theory; otherwise
 it is incompatible: either the theory is wrong or inapplicable, 
\emph on
or the experiment has some unaccounted for error

It is actually possible for both of these things to be true.
 For example, in 1918 Eddington led an expedition to measure the bending
 of starlight caused by the sun's gravity.
 He announced a definite effect in agreement with Einstein's new theory
 of general relativity and overthrowing Newtonian gravity.
 This caused Einstein to become an overnight sensation.
 Later, it turned out that Eddington's measurement was in error, but Einstein
 was still right and Newton was still wrong.
 Today there are many spectacular confirmations of general relativity, including
 GPS.

Actually it is more subtle than this, as we will see.
 Often we assign a probability to an error bar rather than a certainty (i.e.,
 we say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

with a probability of 95% 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is between 
\begin_inset Formula $x-\Delta x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x+\Delta x$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Also, there can be uncertainties in the theoretical prediction due to,
 for example, approximations made in the calculation.
 So one often finds articles stating 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the data are 
\emph on
in tension
\emph default
 with the theory,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 rather than contradicting it outright.

I mentioned accuracy and precision before.
 These are different concepts.
 An ideal measurement has both accuracy and precision.
 A measurement is 
\emph on
accurate
\emph default
 if the average of many repetitions of the measurement tends to the true
 value as the number of repetitions increases.
 If the measurement is inaccurate then the average of repetitions will converge
 to some other value than the true value.
 A 
\emph on
precise
\emph default
 measurement is one that has nearly the same value on every repetition.
 A set of repetitions of an imprecise measurement shows a great deal of
 scatter.
 These qualities can be illustrated with a target analogy.
 In this analogy a measurement is represented by an arrow shot at a target,
 with the true value at the bullseye.
 A set of repetitions is shown in Figure

\begin_layout Standard
Inaccuracy and imprecision cause two different types of errors: systematic
 and random errors respectively.
 
\emph on
Random errors
\emph default
 or, equivalently, 
\emph on
statistical errors
\emph default
 are the result of uncontrollable random processes involved in the measurement.
 Examples include electrical noise, radioactive decays and reaction times
 (as in timing something with a stopwatch etc.).
 These errors benefit from averaging: when a measurement is repeated sometimes
 the random errors will produce a value larger than the true value, but
 other times they will produce a value smaller than the true value.
 Averaging together multiple repetitions washes out the individual fluctuations
 and produces a more certain estimate of the true value.
 The general rule of thumb is that the mean of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 independent repetitions of a measurement with an error of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset

 has an error of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x/\sqrt{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Much more on this later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Systematic errors
\emph default
 are those that affect all repetitions of a measurement equally and hence
 do not average out.
 They are the result of factors which could be corrected if they were known
 about, for example: miscalibrated measuring equipment, unaccounted for
 environmental effects, misalignments etc.
 Finding and eliminating systematic errors is essentially the craft of experimen
tal physics.
 An undiagnosed systematic error means you are not really measuring what
 you think you are, which can lead to potentially serious consequences.
 A parable and a modern day case study will amply illustrate the point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parable tells of a man who wanted to measure the height of the emperor
 of China.
 So he travelled through China asking each person what they thought the
 height of the emperor was.
 We suppose they all know the height of the emperor to a precision of at
 least 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x=\pm1\ \mathrm{m}$
\end_inset

.
 If our researcher asks 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1\,000\,000\,000$
\end_inset

 people then the standard logic dictates that averaging their results gives
 an error in the mean of
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "JAYNESBOOK"

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\Delta x}{\sqrt{n}}=3\times10^{-5}\ \mathrm{m}=0.03\ \mathrm{mm}!
\]

\end_inset

This result is clearly absurd.
 No one would call this a good way of measuring the height of the emperor
 of China.
 Surely most of the people polled have never even seen the emperor! However,
 a common folklore would have grown up around him as people told and discussed
 stories of their emperor
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is common.
 To this day people persist in the illusion that Napoleon Bonaparte was
 short.
 He was average height for the time.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This measurement is thus a very precise measurement 
\emph on
of the folklore
\emph default
, but not of the actual height of the emperor.
 There is a systematic error propagated through the entire population which
 causes an illusion of the emperor distinct from the reality.
 The only way to obtain an accurate measurement of the emperor is to find
 the man himself and measure him.
 Of course, this is consistent with all common sense and probability theory.
 Only a failure to distinguish the different types of errors leads to the
 wrong interpretation.

\begin_layout Standard
Our case study is 
\noun on
OPERA
\noun default
: an experiment at the Gran Sasso Laboratory in Italy which measures a beam
 of neutrinos produced at the SPS proton accelerator at CERN in Geneva,
 730 km away (the beam goes through the ground: neutrinos are very weakly
 interacting particles, and pass through the Earth almost like it is not
 there).
 The neutrinos are produced in timed bunches.
 This set-up, with fixed source and target, allows a very accurate measurement
 of the travel time and hence the velocity of the neutrinos
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is a small part of OPERA's research program.
 The velocity was originally considered a nice measurement they could do
 at no extra cost.
 It was not considered notable until the later controversy broke out.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 According to theory the velocity should be unmeasurably slower than the
 speed of light
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size normal
The velocity is 
\begin_inset Formula $v\approx c\left[1-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{mc^{2}}{E}\right)^{2}+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{m^{3}c^{6}}{E^{3}}\right)\right]$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is the neutrino mass, 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is the speed of light and 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is the neutrino energy.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $mc^{2}\sim1\ \mathrm{eV}$
\end_inset

 and OPERA has 
\begin_inset Formula $E\sim17\ \mathrm{GeV}$
\end_inset

, the neutrinos are expected to go at a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim10^{-21}$
\end_inset

 slower than 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

, which is unmeasurably small.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and certainly not 
\emph on
more
\emph default
 than the speed of light.
 In other words the theory predicts that the measured value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(v-c\right)/c$
\end_inset

 should be consistent with zero.
 However, in 2011 OPERA reported a definitive measurement that the neutrinos
 travelled faster than light.
 They reported the result as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(v-c\right)/c=\left(2.37\pm0.32\left(\mathrm{stat.}\right)_{-0.24}^{+0.34}\left(\mathrm{sys.}\right)\right)\times10^{-5}.
\]

\end_inset

There are a few things to notice here.
 They report the statistical uncertainty 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm0.32\left(\mathrm{stat.}\right)$
\end_inset

 and the systematic uncertainty 
\begin_inset Formula $_{-0.24}^{+0.34}\left(\mathrm{sys.}\right)$
\end_inset

 separately.
 Also, the systematic uncertainty has asymmetric error bars.
 The notation 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{-\Delta x_{2}}^{+\Delta x_{1}}$
\end_inset

 means the true value of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is likely between 
\begin_inset Formula $x-\Delta x_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x+\Delta x_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x_{1}=\Delta x_{2}$
\end_inset

 it is unnecessary to quote the two errors separately and you can use the
 more common notation for a symmetric error bar 
\begin_inset Formula $x\pm\Delta x$
\end_inset

.
 Also, note that they have pulled the common factor 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-5}$
\end_inset

 out of the whole central value and error bar expression.
 This makes the result easier to read.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-5}$
\end_inset

 multiplies every number inside the parenthesis.
 Finally, notice that the smallest possible value for 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 obtains if the statistical and systematic uncertainties are the most negative
 they can be: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left(v-c\right)/c\right]_{\mathrm{minimum}}=\left(2.37-0.32-0.24\right)\times10^{-5}=1.81\times10^{-5}$
\end_inset

.
 Not only is this greater than zero, it differs from zero by more than five
 times the statistical uncertainty.
 This means that such a large disagreement is very unlikely to arise by
 chance.
 Thus OPERA confidently announced a 
\emph on
statistically significant
\emph default
 measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $v>c$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two possibilities at this point: either not all sources of error
 were accounted for or the theory (Einstein's theory of special relativity)
 is wrong.
 While the media excitedly produced a torrent of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Einstein proved wrong
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 articles, the OPERA team set about the job of checking and re-checking
 everything that could possibly go wrong with their experiment.
 After months of work they were able to find two systematic errors that
 had not been accounted for: an incorrectly connected fibre optic cable
 and a drifting over time of the master clock.
 On fixing both these problems and re-running the experiment (with several
 other cross-checks) a revised measurement was obtained:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(v-c\right)/c=\left(2.7\pm3.1\left(\mathrm{stat.}\right)_{-3.3}^{+3.4}\left(\mathrm{sys.}\right)\right)\times10^{-6},
\]

\end_inset

which you can see is consistent with zero as theory predicted 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Since that time three other experiments have confirmed that neutrino velocities
 are compatible with the speed of light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From a scientific perspective the provisional result and ensuing investigation
 and confirmatory experiments were handled correctly according to the scientific
 method.
 Unfortunately however, the press release led to a torrent of sensationalism
 in the media, which damaged the reputation of the OPERA team and lead to
 internal tensions, eventually resulting in several of the team leaders
 resigning from their leadership positions.
 There are two morals to the story: understanding and estimating the systematic
 uncertainties is crucial to the correct interpretation of an experiment;
 and hold carefully to the maxim 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 especially when talking to the general public.
 The cost of a mistake can be your career.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some other special types of errors worth mentioning.
 
\emph on
Digitisation error
\emph default
 is a random error that results from the limited precision of a decimal
 approximation to a real number.
 For example, suppose you are reading a digital voltmeter with the display
 format 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{XXX.XX}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the device can only display two digits after the decimal point the
 remaining digits of the true value must be rounded in some way.
 Different devices can do the rounding differently but you would generally
 expect 
\begin_inset Formula $0.004999\cdots$
\end_inset

 to round down and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.005000\cdots$
\end_inset

 to round up (this is by far the most common rounding method, but it is
 not universal).
 Assuming this is the rounding method then we know that a reading of 
\begin_inset Formula $123.45$
\end_inset

 volts corresponds to a true value between 
\begin_inset Formula $123.445$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $123.455$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we report the reading as the central value 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

 the difference between the central and the extremes
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is a case to be made for dividing the digitisation error by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{3}$
\end_inset

 before quoting it.
 This gives 
\begin_inset Formula $123.450\pm0.003$
\end_inset

 in the present case.
 The reasoning behind this will be discussed in the Advanced Topics section.
 For this course do not divide the error.
\end_layout

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $123.450\pm0.005$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Rounding error
\emph default
 is a related form of error when you round results at an intermediate stage
 of calculation.
 Rounding errors compound with each step of the calculation and numerical
 accuracy can be killed with surprisingly few stages of rounding.
 So take this advice: keep as many digits as possible in the intermediate
 stages of a computation, and only round off to a reasonable few at the
 final stage of reporting your results.
 Even better is to organise your calculations such that the minimum number
 of steps is required.
 For example, derive as many of the quantities of interest as possible as
 analytical formulae involving the things you immediately measure, and only
 substitute in the numerical values at the last stage.
 There are other tricks for organising your algebra.
 For example, if you need to compute a third order polynomial function 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)=a+bx+cx^{2}+dx^{3}$
\end_inset

 don't do it as written (which involves six multiplications and three additions).
 Instead rearrange the computation as 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)=a+x\left(b+x\left(c+dx\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 which only involves three multiplications and three additions.
 Generally if the expressions have a lot of structure or repeating patterns
 they can be rearranged in some way to reduce the number of steps.
 Be especially careful if you need to take the difference of two large,
 close numbers to get a small number.
 For example, if you take 
\begin_inset Formula $12456-12453=3$
\end_inset

, but if you round prematurely you might get 
\begin_inset Formula $12460-12450=10$
\end_inset

 or even 
\begin_inset Formula $12500-12500=0$
\end_inset

! If you take basic precautions such as these, rounding error should be
 such a small part of your final uncertainties that we will not worry about
 how to estimate it.

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Random
\emph default
 or

 errors are due to unpredictable and uncontrollable influences on the experiment.
 These errors can generally be reduced by averaging repetitions of the experimen

 influences to have changed, but not so much time has passed that the thing
 to be measured has itself changed.

Absolute and Relative Errors, Quoting of Errors

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So now that we have seen the importance of estimating errors and the different
 types of errors, how do you quote them? There are two basic ways.
 
\emph on
Absolute
\emph default
 errors are errors measured on an absolute scale in the same units as the
 measurement itself.
 For example, when measuring an electric current of 
\begin_inset Formula $250.0\ \mathrm{mA}$
\end_inset

 with a device that only shows tenths place there is a digitisation error
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.05\ \mathrm{mA}$
\end_inset

.
 This is in the same units as the thing we are measuring and is a characteristic
 of the measuring device independent of the scale of the thing being measured.
 It is an absolute error and we can report it as 
\begin_inset Formula $250.00\pm0.05\ \mathrm{mA}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the central value and the error are given in the same units and
 the unit is listed once at the end of the expression.
 Another common way of reporting the same value is 
\begin_inset Formula $250.00\left(5\right)\ \mathrm{mA}$
\end_inset

.
 The number in parenthesis indicates the uncertainty in the last digit.
 If the number in parenthesis had two digits it would represent the uncertainty
 in the last two digits, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $250.00\left(15\right)\ \mathrm{mA}$
\end_inset

 is the same as 
\begin_inset Formula $250.00\pm0.15\ \mathrm{mA}$
\end_inset

.
 You can use either notation so long as you are clear about the meaning
 of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Relative
\emph default
 errors are the error reported as a fraction of the measured value.
 These gives a sense of how large the error is compared to the measurement
 itself, and are most often reported as percentages.
 In our case we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
0.05\ \mathrm{mA}/250.00\ \mathrm{mA}=0.02\%,
\]

\end_inset

and we could quote 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(250.00\pm0.02\%\right)\ \mathrm{mA}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the relative error does not directly tell you much about the
 measuring device.
 For example, if the central value were ten times smaller the absolute digitisat
ion error would still be the same (assuming the meter does not change the
 display format as the scale changes), i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $25.00\pm0.05\ \mathrm{mA}$
\end_inset

.
 The relative error in this case is ten times larger, 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2\%$
\end_inset

.
 So relative errors are not as meaningful as absolute errors without also
 knowing the central value.
 However, relative errors are useful for many other purposes and are often
 a good way to quote the error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now the matter of rounding.
 If you followed the advice of Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Precision-and-Accuracy-and-Types-of-Errors"

\end_inset

 and held off rounding intermediate results you will wind up with an end
 result something like 
\begin_inset Formula $123.45678901\pm0.00234567$
\end_inset

.
 I hope it is obvious that this has far too many figures.
 In practice you hardly ever know the uncertainty to better than two significant
 figures.
 In fact, you often only know the uncertainty to one significant figure.
 It is meaningless to quote digits of the central value that are a tiny
 fraction of the uncertainty: by the very definition of uncertainty you
 should have no confidence in these extra digits.
 So you should round your final results.
 Needless to say there is no universal standard for how to do this.
 For example, no less of an authority than the Particle Data Group offers
 this gem
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PDG2012"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
The basic rules states that if the three highest order digits of the error
 lie between 100 and 354, we round to two significant digits.
 If they lie between 355 and 949, we round to one significant digit.
 Finally, if they lie between 950 and 999, we round up to 1000 and keep
 two significant digits.
 In all cases, the central value is given with a precision that matches
 that of the error.
 So, for example, the result (coming from an average) 
\begin_inset Formula $0.827\pm0.119$
\end_inset

 would appear as 
\begin_inset Formula $0.83\pm0.12$
\end_inset

, while 
\begin_inset Formula $0.827\pm0.367$
\end_inset

 would turn into 
\begin_inset Formula $0.8\pm0.4$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Don't do this! Life for a physics student is hard enough already without
 also having to cope with such a bizarre rounding rule.
 For the purpose of your undergraduate career you should round the error
 
\emph on
up
\emph default
 to two significant digits and round (standard rounding) the central value
 to a commensurate precision.
 So in the two examples above you should report 
\begin_inset Formula $0.83\pm0.12$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.83\pm0.37$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 In my example you would quote 
\begin_inset Formula $123.4568\pm0.0024$
\end_inset

.
 Others will tell you to always round an error up to one significant figure
 (so, e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm0.22$
\end_inset

 becomes 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm0.3$
\end_inset

), but sometimes this gets rid of too much information.
 For our purposes keeping two digits of the error is a fair compromise between
 being ultra-conservative keeping one digit and keeping meaningless extra
 digits, so long as you keep in mind that often the second digit of the
 error is itself fairly flexible.
 As I said, you almost never know more than two digits of the error, and
 often you only know one digit.
 If one of your instructors marks you down for keeping two digits of the
 error send them this document.

There is no universal standard for rounding when quoting final results,
 but a generally good system is to round errors 
\emph on
up
\emph default
 with two significant figures, and round central values in the usual way
 to a precision commensurate with the error.
 E.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $123.654\pm0.234$
\end_inset

 rounds to 
\begin_inset Formula $123.65\pm0.24$
\end_inset

.
 The second digit of the error is often only a rough figure.

Often you want to estimate the slope and/or intercept of a linear relationship
 between two variables.
 We will only consider linear relationships in this section.
 If you are interested in fitting a non-linear relationship then you can
 either linearise it using some methods we will discuss shortly, or resort
 to more advanced statistical techniques that are not covered here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose you have two variables 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, which you suppose are related by 
\begin_inset Formula $y=mx+b$
\end_inset

: a linear relationship with slope 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and intercept 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
 You measure a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 values 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,\cdots,N$
\end_inset

, and corresponding 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 values 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Both sets of measurements have corresponding uncertainties 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta y_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 What can you infer from this about 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 and, importantly, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta b$
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are mathematical and graphical ways of handling this.
 We will leave the discussion of the mathematical methods to Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Advanced-Topics"

\end_inset

, except to note in passing that linear regression (a.k.a.
 least squares regression), which is widely available in many software packages
 such as Excel, PASW, and programming libraries such as LAPACK (Fortran),
 GSL (C/C++) and NumPy (Python), is very often the 
\emph on

\emph default
 tool for the job.
 See

 for an excellent discussion and tutorial about practical mathematical fitting
 methods for real world data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That said, we will focus on the graphical method.
 Fitting data by eye is necessarily a subjective procedure, but the very
 subjectivity of it allows an easy (though subjective!) estimate of the
 uncertainties.
 An obvious shortcoming of the method is that we are limited to a relationship
 between two variables (the mathematical methods can be easily extended
 to many thousands of variables).
 So let's start with some data.
 The data is shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:sample-data-for-linear-fitting"

\end_inset

.
 This 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 and added in noise with

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT

.
 So we 
\emph on
know
\emph default
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

truth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in this case.
 Generating synthetic data sets like this is often a useful way to develop
 your analysis methods before applying them to real data.
 For example, cosmologists working on the Planck satellite project to measure
 the cosmic microwave background developed their analysis on fake data (while
 the real data was kept hidden, or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

blinded
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) so that any features in the real data would not bias the methods used,
 and so cast doubt on the results.
 In any case you would plot this data as shown in Figure

\begin_layout Standard
Often you can't directly measure the thing you are interested in.
 Instead you compute it as a function of quantities you can measure.
 But if you are uncertain about the value of some quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y,z,\cdots$
\end_inset

, then obviously you will also be uncertain about the value of a function
 of them 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x,y,z\right)$
\end_inset

.
 How do you find out the uncertainty in 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

? You might imagine the simplest thing to do is to sample the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 at many different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y,z$
\end_inset

 which are compatible with your measurements.
 This is in fact the Monte Carlo method that we will explore in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Advanced-Topics"

\end_inset

.
 It is a practical method if 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is very complicated, or the number of variables is very large, or if their
 uncertainties are correlated

\end_inset

 is not a very smooth function of its arguments.

prior probability distributions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

likelihood functions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to do the estimation properly.
 There is an enormous literature on this subject which we only scratch the
 surface of in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Advanced-Topics"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Since we are often interested in simple functions of only a few variables
 we can use simple analytical rules to propagate uncertainties with pen
 and paper instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is the general rule you will use for any undergrad subject:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta f\left(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0},\cdots\right)=\left|\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right|_{x=x_{0},\cdots}\Delta x+\left|\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right|_{x=x_{0},\cdots}\Delta y+\left|\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\right|_{x=x_{0},\cdots}\Delta z+\cdots,
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\right|$
\end_inset

 means absolute value and the subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $x=x_{0},\cdots$
\end_inset

 means to evaluate all the derivatives at the measured values 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 There is a term in the sum for each variable the function depends on.
 The absolute value sign is there so that each term contributes positively
 to the final result: increasing the uncertainty of any variable should
 always increase, and never decrease, the uncertainty of the function itself.
 An important point here is that the errors in the different variables must
 be uncorrelated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The justification for this rule is the Taylor series expansion for a function
 of several variables (we'll drop the 
\begin_inset Formula $z,\cdots$
\end_inset

 for brevity here, you can generalize this to any number of arguments):
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
f\left(x_{0}+\delta x,y_{0}+\delta y\right) & =f\left(x_{0},y_{0}\right)+\left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right|_{x=x_{0},\cdots}\delta x+\left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right|_{x=x_{0},\cdots}\delta y\\
 & +\frac{1}{2}\left.\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial x^{2}}\right|_{x=x_{0},\cdots}\delta x^{2}+\left.\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial x\partial y}\right|_{x=x_{0},\cdots}\delta x\delta y\\
 & +\frac{1}{2}\left.\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial y^{2}}\right|_{x=x_{0},\cdots}\delta y^{2}+\cdots,
\end{align*}

\end_inset

You can see the similarity.
 The main differences are that 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x,\delta y,\cdots$
\end_inset

 can have any sign while 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x,\Delta y,\cdots$
\end_inset

 are always positive, so there are absolute value signs in the equation
 for the error; and that in the error formula we have dropped second and
 higher order terms in 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x,\delta y$
\end_inset

.
 This is what we mean by 
\emph on
linear error propagation
\emph default
: we are essentially approximating a curved surface (the graph of the function
 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

) by a flat plane tangent to the surface at the measured point (c.f.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:uncertain-function"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This works so long as all the higher order terms are much smaller than the
 linear terms, e.g.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial x^{2}}\right|_{x=x_{0},\cdots}\Delta x^{2}\ll\left|\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right|_{x=x_{0},\cdots}\Delta x,
\]

\end_inset

etc.
 (All higher order terms have to be much smaller than all linear terms.)
 This means the errors can't be too big:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta x\ll\frac{\left|\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right|_{x=x_{0},\cdots}}{\left|\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial x^{2}}\right|_{x=x_{0},\cdots}},\ \mathrm{etc.},
\]

\end_inset

which is usually the case.
 The most important case where linear error propagation fails is if the
 measured value happens to be near a 
\emph on
maximum, minimum,
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
inflection point
\emph default
 of the function.
 In that case linear error propagation 
\emph on
under-estimates
\emph default
 the error and you must use a non-linear error propagation technique which
 takes curvature of the function into account.

There is another, more subtle issue at work in our error propagation formula.
 It is not one you should worry about for your labs, but you should be aware
 of it.
 It is actually a fairly subtle, but crucially important point that was
 missed by many of the brightest minds for hundreds of years
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MOSTDANGEROUSEQ"

\end_inset

: in some cases our formula dramatically 
\emph on
over-estimates
\emph default
 the error.
 This is a concern especially when you are averaging multiple repetitions
 of a measurement to reduce the random error.
 Before getting there we will first use our general formula to derive some
 simple rules that will be very useful in practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose our function consists of multiplication by an exact constant (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{circumference}=2\pi\times\mathrm{radius}$
\end_inset

 where the radius is being measured): 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)=cx$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial f/\partial x=c$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta f=c\Delta x$
\end_inset

.
 Convince yourself this should be obvious (you might think about unit conversion
s).
 What if we are adding two measured values together, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x,y\right)=x+y$
\end_inset

? Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial f/\partial x=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial f/\partial y=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ $
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\Delta f=\Delta x+\Delta y$
\end_inset

.
 Again this should be fairly obvious.
 Here we can see what happens if variables are correlated.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is not really independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, but instead 
\begin_inset Formula $y=-x$
\end_inset

 exactly.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x,y\right)=x+y=0$
\end_inset

 exactly, no matter how uncertain we are in our measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 But linear error propagation would say 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta f=\Delta x+\Delta y=2\Delta x$
\end_inset

 (remember 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x,\Delta y$
\end_inset

 are always positive!).
 So in the case of perfect (anti)correlation our formula over-estimates
 the error.
 These situations are fairly rare, and they can be handled on a case by
 case basis.
 This is not the problem I alluded to before, though it is closely related
 to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remember how I said that the error in an average of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 independent repeat observations with uncertainty 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$

? Let's see what the linear error propagation rule says:

Consider weighted averaging of repeated measurements 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},\cdots,x_{N}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(x_{1},\cdots,x_{N}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_{i}x_{i},
\]

\end_inset

where the weights obey
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_{i}=1,
\]

\end_inset

and the individual measurements have different errors 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 We would like to choose the weights so that the error of the average is
 as small as possible.
 Prove that using our linear error propagation rule the minimum 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta f$
\end_inset

 is always obtained for 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\hat{i}}=1$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{i}$
\end_inset

 denotes the observation with the minimum uncertainty and all other 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{j}=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $j\neq\hat{i}$
\end_inset

.
 (Hint: you may start from this solution and show that no change to it can
 decrease the error.) Note that if the best two (or more) observations have
 the same error there is no unique solution for minimum error.

This means that the best strategy under linear error propagation is to take
 the single best observation and ignore all the rest.
 Not averaging! This is exactly what people did for many years before probabilit
y theory was better understood, but now it is known that averaging is actually
 better, and there is a subtle mistake in the linear error propagation formula.
 The problem is that there is still useful information contained in the
 less certain measurements that linear error propagation is leading us to
 throw away.
 Independent errors actually tend to wash each other out more so than our
 error formula suggests.
 This is especially important when a large number of samples are being averaged.

\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=\left(\Delta x_{i}\right)^{-2}\left[\sum_{j=1}^{N}\left(\Delta x_{j}\right)^{-2}\right]^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 What happens if all the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x_{i}$
\end_inset

 are equal? This time there is a unique solution.
 Does it make sense? This rule means each observation should be weighted
 inversely proportionally to the square of its uncertainty.
 Does that make intuitive sense?

How can we have two different rules for error propagation? The two rules

two different things

 that we have so far been using the same word for (

Take

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $x=10\pm3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y=20\pm4$
\end_inset

 Compute 
\begin_inset Formula $f\pm\Delta f$
\end_inset

 using both linear error propagation and quadrature.
 Which is larger and by how much?
\begin_inset Note Note

linear: 
\begin_inset Formula $30\pm7$

\begin_layout Standard
It is clear where the difference is coming from in this exercise.
 Linear error propagation is computing 
\emph on
the range over which 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 can vary
\emph default
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y$
\end_inset

 consistent with the measured values.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 both err upwards then 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x+\Delta x,y+\Delta y\right)=\left(10+3\right)+\left(20+4\right)=30+7$
\end_inset

 and similarly 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x-\Delta x,y-\Delta y\right)=30-7$
\end_inset

.
 So the range of possible 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 values is 
\begin_inset Formula $30\pm7$
\end_inset

 and this is exactly what you compute with linear error propagation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, quadrature is computing the 
\emph on
range of likely values of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset


\emph default
 (for some definition of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

likely
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that we will say much more about in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Advanced-Topics"

\end_inset

).
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 are independent then upward fluctuations of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 are just as likely to occur with 
\emph on
downward
\emph default
 fluctuations of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 and vice versa.
 So while 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
could be
\emph default
 as large as 
\begin_inset Formula $37$
\end_inset

 or small as 
\begin_inset Formula $23$
\end_inset

, it is 
\emph on
more likely
\emph default
 to be closer to 
\begin_inset Formula $30$
\end_inset

 than either extreme, since the fluctuations in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 will often cancel out.
 We will see in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Advanced-Topics"

\end_inset

 not only how you can compute a summary statistic (
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta f$
\end_inset

) but also the actual 
\emph on
probability distribution
\emph default
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 (Needless to say, you will not need all this machinery for your lab reports,
 although if you read an experimental paper in astronomy or particle physics
 you are likely to see a great deal of this sort of probability analysis.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This issue is particularly acute in the case where you have many variables,
 such as an average.
 Suppose you are averaging 
\begin_inset Formula $1000$
\end_inset

 independent measurements.
 The chance of 
\emph on
all 
\begin_inset Formula $1000$
\end_inset

 of them
\emph default
 having a fluctuation in the same direction is minuscule.
 It is far more likely for roughly 
\begin_inset Formula $500$
\end_inset

 to fluctuate upwards, roughly 
\begin_inset Formula $500$
\end_inset

 to fluctuate downwards, and the errors are likely to wash out.
 The quadrature formula accounts for this.
 The linear error propagation formula does not: it tells you that, no matter
 how unlikely the event, 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $1000$
\end_inset

 measurements 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 fluctuate in the same direction yielding a much larger error estimate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that I have confused you with this long discussion of two distinct error
 propagation formulas, I will try to make up for it by giving a practical
 recipe.
 Now that you understand the general issue, and you are aware that the machinery
 discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Advanced-Topics"

\end_inset

 automatically handles all cases correctly, in complete generality, you
 can understand that the simple recipe I give in this section is not iron
 clad.
 It is more of a useful rule of thumb that makes sure linear error propagation
 should cover most every case in your labs.
 Here it is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the function you are calculating involves no more than five (5) distinct
 variables, and you believe the errors are uncorrelated and relatively small
 (justifying a Taylor series expansion of the function) use linear error
 propagation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the function is an average of five or more independent measurements of
 the same thing then use quadrature (
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x/\sqrt{N}$
\end_inset

) for the average.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the function involves five or more distinct physical quantities, is highly
 nonlinear, or the errors are strongly correlated, your problem is probably
 complicated enough to need some special treatment using statistical methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some other linear error propagation recipes that you should derive
 as exercises.
