\begin_layout Abstract
These are pedagogical error analysis notes written for 1st/2nd year physics
 undergraduate students as a response to feedback from students that there
 was not sufficient coverage of these ideas in their coursework.
 The notes contain Basic materials, roughly commensurate with what a typical
 undergraduate physics major requires (basic concepts, error estimation
 in measurement and from graphs, and linear error propagation), and Advanced
 Topics for keen students wishing to learn about probability theory, the
 two major schools of statistics (Bayesian and frequentist) and Monte Carlo
 techniques for non-linear error propagation.
 A list of materials for further reading and a summary

Sometimes an entire field can develop bad habits which have become so ingrained

 In physics one of our bad habits is the use of the word

error analysis.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Our students would be greatly helped if we just used the common English
 word that actually means what we have in mind: uncertainty.
 Get this straight:

Physics is a quantitative science which seeks to establish predictive relationsh

 real world.
 But our senses are easily fooled, and our instruments are

\end_inset

 reliable in proportion with their cost.
 When you open up a physics or mathematics textbook you'll often find problems
 where all the relevant data is given to you without any uncertainty, and
 often with a suspicious number of digits (

One of the major benefits to be had from a physics education for people
 who do not go into a physics research career is an appreciation of how
 to estimate, reason with, and live with uncertainty.
 It is really a more self-aware and robust version of ordinary common sense
 \SpecialChar \nobreakdash-
 a training of sceptical and critical thinking skills that are useful in
 any walk of life.
 Unfortunately this important aspect of physics education can often go 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

under the radar,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 without systematic development.
 Lectures are focused on theory, tutorials are focused on homework style
 problems, and in the interest of time and student safety the laboratories

These notes hopefully go some way toward filling the gap.
 These notes are structured in two major sections apart from this introduction.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 addresses the basic topics that you are most likely to need in your course.
 Master this material and you should have no trouble at all on the error
 analysis sections of your lab reports.
 Fortunately the mathematics involved is not really difficult - the most
 advanced thing you'll need is to be able to find the linear approximation
 to a function of several variables at a given point (i.e., partial derivatives).
 In practice, with the rules of thumb you'll find here, the cases where
 you actually have to do this calculation are rare.
 Section

 covers 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Advanced Topics.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 These are optional extras for the interested student.
 These start with a review of probability theory, which by Cox's theorem
 is the unique extension of ordinary (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) logic to handle uncertain propositions.
 From there we discuss the two schools of statistics (the 
\emph on
Bayesians
\emph default
, who were the first and are now staging a major comeback, and the 
\emph on
frequentists
\emph default
, who dominated the statistics of the 20th century) and their different
 approaches to uncertainty, parameter estimation and hypothesis testing.
 Finally we discuss Monte Carlo techniques and their use in propagating
 non-linear uncertainties.
 The basic idea is to simulate error-prone measurements many times with
 a computer's random number generator and look at the distribution of results
 obtained for the calculation(s) of interest.
 A bibliography containing further reading material is provided for students
 who want to explore further.
 Happy trails!

Are errors really that important? In fact it is easy to imagine circumstances
 where the error or uncertainty of a measurement or prediction is at least
 as important as the central value itself.
 For example, suppose you work for 
\noun on

 and you have discovered a rather large asteroid on a potential collision
 course with Earth.
 What do you do? Is it the time to ring up the President and the Hollywood
 action heroes? This dilemma crops up more often than you might think.
 Near Earth asteroids are being discovered faster than ever before (Figure

.
 Yet, at present, there is no major threat from impacts.
 How is this so? Astronomical measurements are only so good, and the positions
 and velocities of these objects are only determined within some uncertainty.
 Further, as they travel along their orbits are perturbed by the gravity
 of the planets and other forces which are harder to model (e.g., the 
\emph on
Yarkovsky effect
\emph default
).
 This means that the predicted position of the asteroid at some future time
 lies within some region of uncertainty.
 If the Earth is inside that volume then there is a potential, but uncertain,
 impact.
 A probability (a number between zero and one representing a degree of certainty
) can be assigned to the impact and this can be factored into the hazard
 as measured by, for example, the Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Only impacts which rate sufficiently highly on the scale merit attention
 by officials.
 Lower scoring impacts are likely to disappear as improved measurements
 reduce the uncertainty of the predicted orbit (Figure

Another example of where estimating and reporting uncertainties is crucial
 is climate change.
 Yes, temperature is going to go up, but by how much? And how certain can
 we be of that prediction? That is the trillion dollar question.
 Figure

 illustrates the range of predictions for the global average temperature.
 Reporting not only the central prediction, but also the range of likely
 values under the various scenarios allows policy makers to (in principle)
 weigh up the risks and benefits of different mitigation policies.
 It also allows one to re-frame the discussion in beneficial ways.
 For instance, instead of fruitlessly debating the

Of course, no undergraduate physics laboratory has the same level of societal
 import as the examples given above.
 Here is a more likely scenario for your course: you are measuring the emission
 spectrum of atomic hydrogen and, after carefully calibrating the equipment
 as best you can, you find that all of your measured spectral lines differ
 in wavelength from their accepted values by a few percent.
 Have you just overturned atomic theory? The answer is: no, you haven't.
 But how can you be sure? This is where error analysis comes in.
 Error analysis is something you do 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 seeing any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

accepted
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 values.
 A number of students have thought that error analysis means comparing measured
 or computed values against published values to see if they differ by, say,
 5% or less, in which case they say the measurement is compatible with the
 accepted value.
 This is completely wrong.
 Maybe you can measure to an accuracy 
\emph on
better
\emph default
 than 5%, in which case the difference is significant.
 Error analysis is knowing the accuracy and precision of your measurement
 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 looking in the back of the book.
 If you don't do the error analysis then you'll never be able to say that
 
\emph on
the number in the back of the book
\emph default
 is wrong, there is no point to doing experiments, and science would never
 advance!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make this all clear we must distinguish between three concepts: the true
 value of some quantity, its measured value, and the theoretical predicted
 value.
 The true value of a quantity is a property of the real world, independent
 of any observer (check your post-modern philosophies at the door please!).
 The measured value is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 directly related to the true value.
 It is a product of the system under study 
\emph on
along with
\emph default
 the measuring device (which may include yourself).
 
\emph on
Classical
\emph default
 intuition suggests that you can reduce the influence of the measuring device
 upon the system to such an extent that, to a very good approximation, a
 measurement can be treated as simply revealing a property of the system.
 However, our 
\emph on
quantum
\emph default
 reality is such that an absolute lower limit to this influence exists:
 measurement is the result of an irreducible interaction between a system
 and a measuring device
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I mention this for completeness.
 The quantum nature of measurements is largely irrelevant in undergraduate
 laboratories.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Finally a theoretical prediction is just that: the output of some theoretician'
s idle musings (or a rigorously defined theoretical framework).
 At the end of the day you will compare the measured value 
\emph on
with uncertainties
\emph default
, something like 
\begin_inset Formula $x\pm\Delta x$
\end_inset

, with the theoretical value 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\mathrm{th}}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $x-\Delta x\leq x_{\mathrm{th}}\leq x+\Delta x$
\end_inset

 you will say the measured value is compatible with the theory; otherwise
 it is incompatible: either the theory is wrong or inapplicable, 
\emph on
or the experiment has some unaccounted for error

It is actually possible for both of these things to be true.
 For example, in 1918 Eddington led an expedition to measure the bending
 of starlight caused by the sun's gravity.
 He announced a definite effect in agreement with Einstein's new theory
 of general relativity and overthrowing Newtonian gravity.
 This caused Einstein to become an overnight sensation.
 Later, it turned out that Eddington's measurement was in error, but Einstein
 was still right and Newton was still wrong.
 Today there are many spectacular confirmations of general relativity, including
 GPS.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Actually it is more subtle than this, as we will see.
 Often we assign a probability to an error bar rather than a certainty (i.e.,
 we say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

with a probability of 95% 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is between 
\begin_inset Formula $x-\Delta x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x+\Delta x$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Also, there can be uncertainties in the theoretical prediction due to,
 for example, approximations made in the calculation.
 So one often finds articles stating 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the data are 
\emph on
in tension
\emph default
 with the theory,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rather than contradicting it outright.
 Except, of course, for the very clear cut cases.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Precision and Accuracy, Types of Errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I mentioned accuracy and precision before.
 These are different concepts.
 An ideal measurement has both accuracy and precision.
 A measurement is 
\emph on
accurate
\emph default
 if the average of many repetitions of the measurement tends to the true
 value as the number of repetitions increases.
 If the measurement is inaccurate then the average of repetitions will converge
 to some other value than the true value.
 A 
\emph on
precise
\emph default
 measurement is one that has nearly the same value on every repetition.
 A set of repetitions of an imprecise measurement shows a great deal of
 scatter.
 These qualities can be illustrated with a target analogy.
 In this analogy a measurement is represented by an arrow shot at a target,
 with the true value at the bullseye.
 A set of repetitions is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for the various types of measurements.

\begin_layout Standard
Inaccuracy and imprecision cause two different types of errors: systematic
 and random errors respectively.
 
\emph on
Random errors
\emph default
 or, equivalently, 
\emph on
statistical errors
\emph default
 are the result of uncontrollable random processes involved in the measurement.
 Examples include electrical noise, radioactive decays and reaction times
 (as in timing something with a stopwatch etc.).
 These errors benefit from averaging: when a measurement is repeated sometimes
 the random errors will produce a value larger than the true value, but
 other times they will produce a value smaller than the true value.
 Averaging together multiple repetitions washes out the individual fluctuations
 and produces a more certain estimate of the true value.
 The general rule of thumb is that the mean of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 independent repetitions of a measurement with an error of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset

 has an error of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x/\sqrt{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Much more on this later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Systematic errors
\emph default
 are those that affect all repetitions of a measurement equally and hence
 do not average out.
 They are the result of factors which could be corrected if they were known
 about, for example: miscalibrated measuring equipment, unaccounted for
 environmental effects, misalignments etc.
 Finding and eliminating systematic errors is essentially the craft of experimen
tal physics.
 An undiagnosed systematic error means you are not really measuring what
 you think you are, which can lead to potentially serious consequences.
 A parable and a modern day case study will amply illustrate the point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parable tells of a man who wanted to measure the height of the emperor
 of China.
 So he travelled through China asking each person what they though the height
 of the emperor was.
 We suppose they all know the height of the emperor to a precision of at
 least 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x=\pm1\ \mathrm{m}$
\end_inset

.
 If our researcher asks 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1\,000\,000\,000$
\end_inset

 people then the standard logic dictates that averaging their results gives
 an error in the mean of
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "JAYNESBOOK"

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\Delta x}{\sqrt{n}}=3\times10^{-5}\ \mathrm{m}=0.03\ \mathrm{mm}!
\]

\end_inset

This result is clearly absurd.
 No one would call this a good way of measuring the height of the emperor
 of China.
 Surely most of the people polled have never even seen the emperor! However,
 a common folklore would have grown up around him as people told and discussed
 stories of their emperor
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is common.
 To this day people persist in the illusion that Napoleon Bonaparte was
 short.
 He was average height for the time.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This measurement is thus a very precise measurement 
\emph on
of the folklore
\emph default
, but not of the actual height of the emperor.
 There is a systematic error propagated through the entire population which
 causes an illusion of the emperor distinct from the reality.
 The only way to obtain an accurate measurement of the emperor is to find
 the man himself and measure him.
 Of course, this is consistent with all common sense and probability theory.
 Only a failure to distinguish the different types of errors leads to the
 wrong interpretation.

 730 km away (the beam goes through the ground: neutrinos are very weakly
 interacting particles, and pass through the Earth almost like it is not
 there).
 The neutrinos are produced in timed bunches.

 of the travel time and hence the velocity of the neutrinos

 According to theory the velocity should be unmeasurably slower than the
 speed of light

The velocity is 
\begin_inset Formula $v\approx c\left[1-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{mc^{2}}{E}\right)^{2}+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{m^{3}c^{6}}{E^{3}}\right)\right]$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is the neutrino mass, 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is the speed of light and 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is the neutrino energy.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $mc^{2}\sim1\ \mathrm{eV}$
\end_inset

 and OPERA has 
\begin_inset Formula $E\sim17\ \mathrm{GeV}$
\end_inset

, the neutrinos are expected to go at a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim10^{-21}$
\end_inset

 slower than 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

, which is unmeasurably small.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and certainly not 
\emph on
more
\emph default
 than the speed of light.
 In other words the theory predicts that the measured value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(v-c\right)/c$
\end_inset

 should be consistent with zero.
 However, in 2011 OPERA reported a definitive measurement that the neutrinos
 travelled faster than light.
 They reported the result as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(v-c\right)/c=\left(2.37\pm0.32\left(\mathrm{stat.}\right)_{-0.24}^{+0.34}\left(\mathrm{sys.}\right)\right)\times10^{-5}.
\]

\end_inset

There are a few things to notice here.
 They report the statistical uncertainty 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm0.32\left(\mathrm{stat.}\right)$
\end_inset

 and the systematic uncertainty 
\begin_inset Formula $_{-0.24}^{+0.34}\left(\mathrm{sys.}\right)$
\end_inset

 separately.
 Also, the systematic uncertainty has asymmetric error bars.
 The notation 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{-\Delta x_{2}}^{+\Delta x_{1}}$
\end_inset

 means the true value of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is likely between 
\begin_inset Formula $x-\Delta x_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x+\Delta x_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x_{1}=\Delta x_{2}$
\end_inset

 it is unnecessary to quote the two errors separately and you can use the
 more common notation for a symmetric error bar 
\begin_inset Formula $x\pm\Delta x$
\end_inset

.
 Also, note that they have pulled the common factor 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-5}$
\end_inset

 out of the whole central value and error bar expression.
 This makes the result easier to read.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-5}$
\end_inset

 multiplies every number inside the parenthesis.
 Finally, notice that the smallest possible value for 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 obtains if the statistical and systematic uncertainties are the most negative
 they can be: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left(v-c\right)/c\right]_{\mathrm{minimum}}=\left(2.37-0.32-0.24\right)\times10^{-5}=1.81$
\end_inset

.
 Not only is this greater than zero, it differs from zero by more than five
 times the statistical uncertainty.
 This means that such a large disagreement is very unlikely to arise by
 chance.
 Thus OPERA confidently announced a 
\emph on
statistically significant
\emph default
 measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $v>c$
\end_inset

.

There are two possibilities at this point: either not all sources of error
 were accounted for or the theory (Einstein's theory of special relativity)
 is wrong.
 While the media excitedly produced a torrent of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Einstein proved wrong
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 articles, the OPERA team set about the job of checking and re-checking
 everything that could possibly go wrong with their experiment.
 After months of work they were able to find two systematic errors that
 had not been accounted for: an incorrectly connected fibre optic cable
 and a drifting over time of the master clock.
 On fixing both these problems and re-running the experiment (with several
 other cross-checks) a revised measurement was obtained:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(v-c\right)/c=\left(2.7\pm3.1\left(\mathrm{stat.}\right)_{-3.3}^{+3.4}\left(\mathrm{sys.}\right)\right)\times10^{-6},
\]

\end_inset

which you can see is consistent with zero as theory predicted

.
 Since that time three other experiments have confirmed that neutrino velocities
 are compatible with the speed of light.
 From a scientific perspective the provisional result and ensuing investigation
 and confirmatory experiments were handled correctly according to the scientific
 method.
 Unfortunately however, the press release led to a torrent of sensationalism
 in the media, which damaged the reputation of the OPERA team and lead to
 internal tensions, eventually resulting in several of the team leaders
 resigning from their leadership positions.
 There are two morals to the story: understanding and estimating the systematic
 uncertainties is crucial to the correct interpretation of an experiment,
 and hold carefully to the maxim

There are some other special types of errors worth mentioning.
 
\emph on
Digitisation error
\emph default
 results from the limited precision of a decimal approximation to a real
 number.
 For example, suppose you are reading a digital voltmeter with the display
 format 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{XXX.XX}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the device can only display two digits after the decimal point the
 remaining digits of the true value must be rounded in some way.
 Different devices can do the rounding differently but you would generally
 expect 
\begin_inset Formula $0.004999\cdots$
\end_inset

 to round down and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.005000\cdots$
\end_inset

 to round up (this is by far the most common rounding method, but it is
 not universal).
 Assuming this is the rounding method then we know that a reading of 
\begin_inset Formula $123.45$
\end_inset

 volts corresponds to a true value between 
\begin_inset Formula $123.445$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $123.455$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we report the reading as the central value 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$

There is a case to be made for dividing the digitisation error by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{3}$
\end_inset

 before quoting it.
 This gives 
\begin_inset Formula $123.450\pm0.003$
\end_inset

 in the present case.
 The reasoning behind this will be discussed in the Advanced Topics section.
 For this course do not divide the error.

\emph on
Rounding error
\emph default
 is a related form of error when you round of results at an intermediate
 stage of calculation.
 Rounding errors compound with each step of the calculation and numerical
 accuracy can be killed with surprisingly few stages of rounding.
 So take this advice: keep as many digits as possible in the intermediate
 stages of a computation, and only round of to a reasonable few at the final
 stage of reporting your results.
 Even better is to organise your calculations such that the minimum number
 of steps is required.
 For example, derive as many the quantities of interest as possible as analytica
l formulae involving the things you immediately measure, and only substitute
 in the numerical values at the last stage.
 There are other tricks for organising your algebra.
 For example, if you need to compute a third order polynomial function 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)=a+bx+cx^{2}+dx^{3}$
\end_inset

 don't do it as written (which involves six multiplications and three additions).
 Instead rearrange the computation as 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)=a+x\left(b+x\left(c+dx\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 which only involves three multiplications and three additions.
 Generally if the expressions have a lot of structure or repeating patterns
 they can be rearranged in some way to reduce the number of steps.
