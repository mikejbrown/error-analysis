## Error Analysis Notes

# Abstract
These are pedagogical error analysis notes written for 1st/2nd year physics
undergraduate students as a response to feedback from students that there was
not sufficient coverage of these ideas in their coursework. The notes contain
Basic materials, roughly commensurate with what a typical undergraduate physics
major requires (basic concepts, error estimation in measurement and from
graphs, and linear error propagation), and Advanced Topics for keen students
wishing to learn about probability theory, the two major schools of statistics
(Bayesian and frequentist) and Monte Carlo techniques for non-linear error
propagation. A list of materials for further reading and a summary 'cheat sheet'
are also provided at the end. This open source document is licensed under a [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/||Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License].
